- **Patch Management**: The process of managing software updates and patches to correct vulnerabilities and improve security.
- **Social Engineering**: Techniques used to manipulate individuals into divulging confidential information or performing actions that compromise security.
- **Zero-Day**: A software vulnerability that is unknown to the software vendor and has not yet been patched, often exploited by attackers.
- **Backup**: The process of making copies of data to ensure its availability in case of system failure, ransomware, or data corruption.

## Intermediate Cybersecurity Terminology
- **Threat Intelligence**: Information about potential or actual attacks, used to inform and enhance security defenses, typically gathered from multiple sources.
- **Intrusion Detection System (IDS)**: A device or software that monitors network traffic for signs of malicious activity or policy violations.
- **Intrusion Prevention System (IPS)**: A system that actively monitors network traffic and blocks potentially malicious activities, complementing an IDS.
- **Risk Assessment**: The process of identifying and analyzing potential risks to an organization’s assets, followed by the implementation of measures to mitigate them.
- **Access Control**: Mechanisms and policies for regulating who can access a system and what they are allowed to do, including authentication and authorization processes.
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: A security mechanism that requires more than one method of authentication from independent categories to verify a user’s identity.
- **Vulnerability Management**: The practice of identifying, classifying, remediating, and mitigating vulnerabilities in software and systems.
- **Penetration Testing (Pen Test)**: The practice of simulating attacks on a system to identify vulnerabilities that could be exploited by malicious actors.
- **Ransomware**: A type of malware that encrypts a user’s data and demands payment, often in cryptocurrency, in exchange for decryption.
- **Network Segmentation**: Dividing a computer network into sub-networks to improve security by limiting the scope of potential attacks.

## Advanced Cybersecurity Terminology
- **Advanced Persistent Threat (APT)**: A long-term, targeted cyberattack that involves sophisticated techniques to infiltrate a system and remain undetected for extended periods.
- **Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA)**: A security model that assumes no user or device is inherently trusted and that every request, both inside and outside the network, must be verified before access is granted.
- **SIEM (Security Information and Event Management)**: A comprehensive solution that provides real-time analysis of security alerts generated by hardware and software infrastructures to detect, analyze, and respond to potential security threats.
- **SOC (Security Operations Center)**: A facility or team responsible for monitoring, detecting, responding to, and managing security incidents in real time.
- **Red Team**: A group of cybersecurity professionals tasked with simulating real-world attacks to test and strengthen an organization’s defenses.
- **Blue Team**: A defensive team responsible for defending an organization from cyberattacks by monitoring, detecting, and responding to incidents.
- **Threat Hunting**: The proactive process of searching for malicious activity or threats that have evaded automated detection tools.
- **Honeypot**: A decoy system designed to attract and trap attackers, providing valuable insights into attack strategies and techniques.
- **Exploit**: A piece of code or sequence of commands that takes advantage of a vulnerability in a system or application.
- **Privilege Escalation**: The act of exploiting a vulnerability or misconfiguration to gain higher-level access to a system, often moving from a regular user to an administrator or root account.
- **Rootkit**: A type of malware that enables an attacker to gain and maintain root-level access to a system while concealing its presence.
- **Cryptojacking**: The unauthorized use of a system's resources to mine cryptocurrency, often done via malware or malicious scripts embedded in websites.
- **Post-Exploitation**: The phase of a cyberattack that occurs after initial access is gained, during which an attacker consolidates their access and attempts to escalate privileges or maintain persistence.
- **Sandboxing**: A security technique used to isolate running programs, especially suspicious ones, to analyze their behavior without risking the security of the rest of the system.
- **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM)**: A type of attack in which the attacker intercepts and possibly alters communications between two parties without their knowledge.
- **SQL Injection**: A web vulnerability that allows an attacker to interfere with the queries an application makes to its database, often to manipulate or retrieve sensitive data.
- **DNS Spoofing**: A type of attack where an attacker manipulates DNS records to redirect traffic to malicious sites or intercept communications.
- **Command and Control (C2)**: A mechanism used by attackers to maintain communication with compromised systems, allowing them to issue commands and exfiltrate data.
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: A vulnerability in web applications that allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into webpages viewed by other users.

## Specialized Cybersecurity Concepts
- **Behavioral Analysis**: The process of monitoring and analyzing the behavior of users or devices to detect abnormal activity that might indicate an attack.
- **Deception Technology**: A defensive strategy that involves deploying decoy assets (e.g., fake systems or data) to mislead attackers and delay their progress.
- **Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)**: An attack that attempts to overwhelm a system or network by flooding it with traffic from multiple sources, often with the goal of making a service unavailable.
- **DNSSEC (Domain Name System Security Extensions)**: A suite of extensions to DNS that adds security to prevent attacks such as DNS spoofing.
- **Steganography**: The practice of concealing data within other non-suspicious files, such as images, to evade detection and deliver payloads in covert ways.
- **TLS/SSL (Transport Layer Security / Secure Sockets Layer)**: Cryptographic protocols that ensure secure communication over a computer network, commonly used in web traffic encryption (HTTPS).
- **Ethical Hacking**: The practice of legally and ethically testing systems for vulnerabilities to improve security, often through penetration testing or vulnerability assessments.
- **Cloud Security**: Measures and protocols designed to secure cloud computing environments, ensuring data privacy and preventing unauthorized access to cloud-based resources.
- **IoT Security**: The practice of securing Internet of Things devices, which are often poorly protected and can serve as an entry point for attacks.

## Incident Response and Forensics
- **Incident Response**: The process of identifying, investigating, containing, and remediating security incidents and breaches in a timely and efficient manner.
- **Digital Forensics**: The science of recovering, preserving, and analyzing data from digital devices to investigate and understand how a security breach occurred.
- **Chain of Custody**: The documentation and handling process that ensures the integrity of digital evidence during an investigation, maintaining a clear record of who had access to the evidence and how it was handled.

## Legal and Compliance Terminology
- **GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)**: A regulation in the European Union that mandates strict guidelines for the protection of personal data and privacy.
- **HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act)**: A U.S. law that sets standards for protecting sensitive patient data in healthcare.
- **PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard)**: A set of security standards for protecting credit card data and maintaining secure payment systems.
- **SOC 2 (Service Organization Control 2)**: A standard for managing customer data based on five key principles: security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, and privacy.
