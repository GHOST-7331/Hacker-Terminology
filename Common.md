- **Hacking**: Gaining unauthorized access to systems or data.

## I
- **IP Spoofing**: The act of sending packets from a false source IP address to disguise the origin.
- **Incident Response**: The approach taken by an organization to handle and mitigate a security breach or attack.

## J
- **Jacking**: A type of attack in which an attacker steals a legitimate userâ€™s session token to impersonate them.

## K
- **Keylogger**: Malicious software or hardware that records keystrokes to capture sensitive information like passwords.

## L
- **Lateral Movement**: The technique of moving within a network to explore and access other systems after initial compromise.
- **Loader**: A type of malware designed to deliver and execute another payload on the victim's machine.

## M
- **Malware**: Malicious software designed to disrupt, damage, or gain unauthorized access to a computer system.
- **MITM (Man-In-The-Middle)**: An attack where the attacker intercepts and possibly alters communications between two parties without their knowledge.

## N
- **Nmap**: A network scanning tool used to discover hosts and services on a computer network.
- **Null Byte**: A character that is used to terminate strings in certain programming languages, often exploited in injection attacks.

## O
- **OSINT (Open Source Intelligence)**: Intelligence gathered from publicly available sources.
- **OWASP**: The Open Web Application Security Project, an organization dedicated to improving software security.

## P
- **Penetration Testing**: Simulated cyberattack on a system to identify vulnerabilities before malicious actors can exploit them.
- **Privilege Escalation**: A technique used to gain higher-level permissions on a system than originally granted.
  
## Q
- **QR Code Phishing**: A method of phishing where malicious QR codes are used to trick users into visiting a malicious site.

## R
- **RAT (Remote Access Trojan)**: A type of malware that gives an attacker remote control over an infected system.
- **Reconnaissance**: The first phase of an attack where information about a target system or network is gathered.

## S
- **SQL Injection**: A vulnerability that allows attackers to interfere with the queries an application makes to its database.
- **Social Engineering**: Manipulating people into divulging confidential information or performing actions that compromise security.

## T
- **Trojan Horse**: A type of malware that masquerades as legitimate software to trick users into installing it.
- **Tokenization**: The process of replacing sensitive data with a non-sensitive equivalent, or token.

## U
- **UDP Flood**: A form of DoS attack where the attacker floods a target with UDP packets.
- **URL Spoofing**: The act of manipulating a URL to mislead users into thinking they are visiting a legitimate site.

## V
- **Vulnerability**: A weakness in a system that could be exploited by an attacker.
- **VPN (Virtual Private Network)**: A tool that encrypts internet traffic to provide privacy and security when accessing networks remotely.

## W
- **WIFI Cracking**: The act of breaking the encryption of a wireless network to gain unauthorized access.
- **Web Shell**: A script that enables an attacker to control a web server remotely.

## X
- **XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)**: A vulnerability that allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users.
  
## Y
- **Zero-Day Vulnerability**: A vulnerability that is unknown to the public or the software vendor, leaving it open to exploitation by attackers.

## Z
- **ZigBee**: A wireless communication standard often used in IoT devices, which can be vulnerable to specific types of attacks.
